âœ… Once you add:
- the **scripts** (`jwt_decoder.py` and `cors_check_local.py`), and  
- the **two short READMEs** (one per module),  

your `arcana-modules-public` repo will be complete and professional-looking.

Do you want me to now prep the **root README.md** (the one at `arcana-modules-public/README.md`) fully polished so it ties everything together like we did with your cheatsheets repo?
