# Arcana Modules (Public)

A collection of sanitized, safe utilities derived from the private Arcana Framework.  
All modules run locally and demonstrate code quality without offensive functionality.

## Included Modules
- `jwt-decoder/` – Offline JWT parser that decodes header and payload safely, without validation or replay.
- `cors-check-local/` – CORS header validator for localhost development servers, useful for testing application responses.

## Usage
These modules are provided for educational use in authorized environments only.  
They are designed to demonstrate implementation quality, not for offensive use against live targets.
